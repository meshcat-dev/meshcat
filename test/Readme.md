# Testing MeshCat

This directory contains various HTML test files that each exercise features of MeshCat.  To view the tests, open a local web server:

  python3 -m http.server 7000

After running that command, open http://127.0.0.1:7000/ and browse through the index of tests. Use Ctrl-C to exit the server.

Some (but not all) test cases will also work correctly when viewed directly as file:// URLs, but we do not recommend this.
